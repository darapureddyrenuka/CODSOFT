# Iris Flower Classification

## Overview
This project classifies Iris flowers into three species (*Setosa*, *Versicolor*, *Virginica*) using machine learning. The dataset consists of sepal and petal measurements for each flower, which are used to train a classification model.

## Features
- Data visualization (histograms, pairplots, boxplots, violin plots, confusion matrix)
- Machine learning model using Random Forest Classifier
- Performance evaluation with accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix
- Automatic storage of visualizations in the `visualizations/` folder

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the script with:
```bash
python iris_classification.py
```
This will train the model, display visualizations, and print the classification results.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the **Iris dataset**, which contains:
- `SepalLengthCm`
- `SepalWidthCm`
- `PetalLengthCm`
- `PetalWidthCm`
- `Species`

## Results
- The **RandomForestClassifier** provides high accuracy.
- Visualizations help in understanding feature distributions.
- The confusion matrix confirms minimal misclassifications.

## Files
- `iris_classification.py`: Main script
- `Iris.csv`: Dataset file
- `visualizations/`: Folder containing saved plots
- `README.md`: Project documentation
- `requirements.txt`: Required dependencies

## Future Improvements
- Try different models like SVM, KNN, and Decision Trees
- Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy
- Deployment as a web app
