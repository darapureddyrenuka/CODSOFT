⚙️ Project Overview
🔹 Step 1: Data Understanding & Preprocessing
The dataset contains advertising budgets across different media platforms (TV, Radio, and Newspaper) and the corresponding Sales figures.
Handling missing values and checking for inconsistencies in the dataset.
Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations to understand the relationship between variables.
🔹 Step 2: Model Selection & Training
Using Linear Regression as the primary model to predict sales based on advertising budgets.
Splitting the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
🔹 Step 3: Model Evaluation
Evaluated the model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² Score.
Achieved an R² Score of 0.91, indicating a strong correlation between ad spend and sales.
🔹 Step 4: Data Visualization
Generated visualizations to analyze trends, including:
✔️ Sales vs. TV Advertising Budget
✔️ Sales vs. Radio Advertising Budget
✔️ Sales vs. Newspaper Advertising Budget

📈 Model Performance
📊 Evaluation Metrics:
✔ Mean Absolute Error (MAE): X.XX
✔ Mean Squared Error (MSE): X.XX
✔ R² Score: X.XX

🖥️ Installation & Running the Project

bash
Copy
Edit
python sales_prediction.py
📊 Data Visualization
After executing the code, visualizations are generated in the visualizations/ folder. These include:
✔ TV Advertising Budget vs. Sales
✔ Radio Advertising Impact on Sales
✔ Newspaper Advertising Influence on Sales

🚀 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Machine Learning can help businesses optimize advertising budgets by predicting future sales. By understanding the correlation between different advertising mediums and revenue, companies can make data-driven decisions to enhance their marketing strategies.
